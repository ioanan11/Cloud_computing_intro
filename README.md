SRE introduction
- What is the role of SRE?
SREs are responsible for availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning.

**Cloud Computing**
- What is Cloud Computing and the benefits of using it?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
Advantages: Cost Savings, Security, Flexibility, Mobility, Insight, Increased Collaboration, Quality Control, Disaster Recovery, Loss Prevention, Automatic Software Updates,
Competitive Edge, Sustainability

**What is Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- What is AWS and benefits of using it
AWS=the cloud platform offered by Amazon. 

Benefits: Comprehensive documentation, cost-effective, secure

**What is SDLS and stages of SDLC**
- What is SDLC and what are the stages of it
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software.
Stages:
1. Requirement analysis
2. Planning
3. Software design such as architectural design
4. Software development
5. Testing
6. Deployment



What are the Risk level at each stage of SDLC?
- LOW
- Medium
- High

Requirement analysis: Medium
Planning: High
Software design: Medium
Software development: Medium
Testing: Low
Deployment: Medium

What is on premise, cloud, hybrid cloud and multi cloud

On premise: data is located within your in-house servers and IT infrastructure
Cloud: A cloud-based server utilizes virtual technology to host a company’s applications offsite.
Hybrid cloud: A hybrid cloud solution is a mix of public cloud and private cloud infrastructure. Organizations might use a private cloud to store sensitive data in an on-premises or colocated data center connected by a private cloud while offloading other workloads to a public cloud service or multiple public clouds.
Multi-cloud: In a multi-cloud environment, an enterprise utilizes multiple public cloud services, most often from different cloud providers. For example, an organization might host its web front-end application on AWS and host its Exchange servers on Microsoft Azure.
