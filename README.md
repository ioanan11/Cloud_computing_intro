SRE introduction
- What is the role of SRE?
SREs are responsible for availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning.

**Cloud Computing**
- What is Cloud Computing and the benefits of using it?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
Advantages: Cost Savings, Security, Flexibility, Mobility, Insight, Increased Collaboration, Quality Control, Disaster Recovery, Loss Prevention, Automatic Software Updates,
Competitive Edge, Sustainability

**What is Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- What is AWS and benefits of using it
AWS=the cloud platform offered by Amazon. 

Benefits: Comprehensive documentation, cost-effective, secure

**What is SDLS and stages of SDLC**
- What is SDLC and what are the stages of it
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software.
Stages:
1. Requirement analysis
2. Planning
3. Software design such as architectural design
4. Software development
5. Testing
6. Deployment


What are the Risk level at each stage of SDLC?
- LOW
- Medium
- High

Requirement analysis: Medium
Planning: High
Software design: Medium
Software development: Medium
Testing: Low
Deployment: Medium
